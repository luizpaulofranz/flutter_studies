# Countries App

This is a study Flutter project focused on studing Flutter Bloc / Cubits and also navigations with [auto_route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route) package.

 - **Navigation:** It works on mobile and web with complex objects as params through the screens. See the "Nested Routes" option on `lib/modules/nested_routes/`.
   - The configurations are in `lib/router`. See also the `main.dart` where we add our router on `MaterialApp`.
 - Blocs and Cubits in `lib/countries/blocs` and `lib/countries/cubits`
